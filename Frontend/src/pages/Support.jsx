                        <strong>Q: How do I upload a video?</strong><br />

                        your video file, add a title and description, and click "Publish". Make sure

                        <strong>Q: Why is my video taking so long to process?</strong><br />
                        A: Video processing time depends on the file size, resolution, and current

                        If you're experiencing technical difficulties with axoryn, try these
                        common solutions first: clear your browser cache and cookies, disable
                        browser extensions temporarily, try using an incognito/private browsing
                        window, or switch to a different browser. Many issues are resolved by
                        these simple steps.

                    <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
                        For video playback issues, ensure you have a stable internet connection
                        and try refreshing the page. If videos won't load or keep buffering,
                        try lowering the video quality using the settings gear icon on the player.
                        Mobile users should ensure they have the latest version of their browser
                        or try using our mobile-optimized interface.
